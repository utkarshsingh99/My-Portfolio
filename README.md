# My-Portfolio
A Webpage designed by the creator giving various details about his life as a coder and a web developer.

The project is just a trial webpage in web designing and development. 

I have started with my introduction, and then listed out the few projects I have made in my short coding career. 
Lastly, I have added my contact details, and a form whose url is "#". :P

The important part is, that there are too many CSS classes designed for each and every division class.
I am, therefore, looking a way to shorten the code by lessening the classes but keeping the design intact.
However, any new design suggestions are welcome.
